Mynotebook is a small and simple Perl-program intended for working with notes on the console. 

The program has command line interface. To run it type on the console './notebook.pl <text-file>' where <text-file> is optional argument which denotes file to edit. It will be created if necessary. Each line of the <text-file> is considered as one note. If <text-file> is omitted, './mynotes.txt' will be created.

I hope this program will be useful for someone.

There is just four commands:
1. a => Add new note # i.e. a test record
2. r => Remove note # i.e. r 3
3. f => Find note # i.e. f <text>
